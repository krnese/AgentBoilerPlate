# Wine Images

This directory contains wine bottle images for the application.

Since this is a demo application, we're using emoji representations in the UI instead of actual images.
The wine cards display appropriate emojis based on the wine type:

- 🍷 Red wines
- 🥂 White wines  
- 🌸 Rosé wines
- �� Sparkling wines

For a production application, you would replace these with actual product photography.

Image requirements for production:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 800x1200px (portrait orientation)
- Resolution: 72-150 DPI
- File naming: wine1.jpg, wine2.jpg, etc. (matching the wines.json data)
